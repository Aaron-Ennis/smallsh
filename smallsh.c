 * Description: This is the main implementation file for a Linux shell program
 * that implements a small subset of features akin to a more full-featured
 * shell like bash or csh. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate some
 * aspects of the UNIX/Linux process API, signals and signal handling and I/O
 * redirection.
